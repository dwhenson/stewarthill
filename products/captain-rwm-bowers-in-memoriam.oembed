I wanted to venerate him in some way so decided on a portrait. This would be my second oil portrait and sixth ever painting so I sought the Commanding Officer of 2 MERCIAN’s permission with trepidation. I offered to paint a portrait of Rupert for the Officers’ Mess but would only present the painting if it looked like Rupert and would honour him.\u003c\/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e  \u003c\/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI wanted permission from his wife also before proceeding.
