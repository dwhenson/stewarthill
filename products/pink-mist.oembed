{"product_id":"pink-mist","title":"Pink Mist","description":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOne of four paintings created to show my time in ‘The Two Worlds of Charlie F’. The term Pink Mist is mentioned in the play and refers to a soldier’s candid description of what happens when an Improvised Explosive Device explodes upon a body. The three men in the painting are from the promotion banner for the play. The sky depicts the potential violence that can be inflicted on any of our soldiers from an IED at any time, once they are outside the safety of a camp or Forward Operating Base. The landscape is of the mountains in Sangin, Afghanistan.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Stewart Hill ","offers":[{"title":"A5","offer_id":36268332351655,"sku":"","price":45.0,"currency_code":"GBP","in_stock":true},{"title":"A4","offer_id":36268332417191,"sku":"","price":65.0,"currency_code":"GBP","in_stock":true},{"title":"A3","offer_id":36268332482727,"sku":"","price":85.0,"currency_code":"GBP","in_stock":true},{"title":"A2","offer_id":36268332548263,"sku":"","price":100.0,"currency_code":"GBP","in_stock":true},{"title":"A1","offer_id":36268332581031,"sku":"","price":120.0,"currency_code":"GBP","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0037\/4236\/7808\/products\/PinkMist.jpg?v=1599488956","url":"https:\/\/stewarthill.co.uk\/products\/pink-mist","provider":"Stewart Hill ","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
